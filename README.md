Tasks for this project:

Lovejoy’s Antique Evaluation Web Application
In this part of the coursework, you will develop a secure web application for a local antique dealer
named Lovejoy. Lovejoy wants a minimum viable product allowing customers to register and then
request evaluations of potential antique objects. Lovejoy has many rivals in the antique business
who may sometimes resort to underhand tactics and so is very concerned about the security of the
application.
Your secure web application will need to have these features for the minimum viable product (MVP)
release: user registration and login, a password policy, “request evaluation” page and then an
extension of the “request evaluation” page file upload to allow upload of photos. Finally, Lovejoy
needs a request listing page
